# AI Tone-Analyzer
The problem statement from our college hackathon was solved in this project.

We have used Gemini API which made our work simple.
when the user speaks anything our backend does the job of transcribing and then analyzing the text.
It gives us the Tone-(what was the tone of the user) and explanation-(it explains the message that the user wants to convey with speech).
